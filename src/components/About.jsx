        Hi there! My name is Kevin Fan and welcome to my portfolio! As a professional photographer, I am always searching for opportunities to capture every beautiful occurring in life. These include animal photography, nature photography, abstract, and even photojournalism! Take a look at my photos and learn more about my professional background!

        My favorite aspect of photography as a professional photographer is the different perspectives of all photographers. Take a deer, for example. One photographer might choose to focus on its face, one might shoot at a bird's eye view, while another might choose to focus only on its eyes! The possibilities of photography is indescribable.

        You may explore the beauty of the world with my photos. Take a virtual safari to Kenya to explore the thirst of life of antelopes, or imagine yourself on a helicopter above the horizons of the great lakes of Masai Mara! Or, observe a flying white egret across the great High Park of Canada! Photography is truly a limitless art.
