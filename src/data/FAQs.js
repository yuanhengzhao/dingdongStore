          <p>
            How much a cat needs to eat depends on a variety of factors,
            including size, age, metabolic rate, the amount it exercises, and
            even environmental temperatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kittens require about 200 calories a day per five pounds of body
            weight (after weaning). Look at the feeding guide on your cat food
            label. This will give you a general idea of how much to put in her
            food bowl.
          </p>{' '}
          <p>
            Many cat owners feed meals in the morning and evening, while others
            leave dry food out during the day. In reality cats love to graze,
            eating multiple small meals throughout the day and night.
          </p>
          Kittens require more food per pound of body weight to support their
          growth than do adult cats, and therefore should be fed more often
          throughout the day. "Growing kittens up to six months of age may
          require three meals a day," says Francis Kallfelz, DVM, Ph.D. How
          often you feed your cat may depend on your schedule as well.

        <div>
          <p>
            Many veterinarians recommend that cats eat a diet of exclusively or
            mostly wet food. There are a couple of reasons for this:
          </p>
          <p>
            First, cats are obligate carnivores and are not designed to ingest
            many carbohydrates (if any). Dry food will automatically contain
            many more carbohydrates than wet food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, most cats are not big water drinkers and tend to keep
            themselves on the edge of dehydration. Wet food naturally provides
            more water in the diet, which supports the kidneys, urinary tract,
            and overall health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Theoretically speaking, if the calories are not exceeded, the
            proportion of wet food in the cat's diet should be as much as
            possible. However, because dry food is easy to store and
            cost-effective, most cat owners will choose dry food as the main
            food, and supplemented by canned food.

            Core vaccines are those recommended for all cats, no matter where

            When Dingdong Paw handed kittens to you, they had completed the
            first vaccine, which included FVRCP vaccine, physical examination,
            and deworming. You need to complete the second and third vaccines
            yourself. It is recommended that you find a veterinary clinic near
            your home with a good reputation, which can save a lot of trouble in
            the future.

            Many cats, especially those with short coats, are good self-groomers
            and rarely require bathing.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, cats can spend up to 50% of their waking hours grooming to
            cover themselves with their scent. So when you step in and bathe
            them, you are essentially erasing their ID.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, if you choose to bathe your cat regularly, you are
            cultivating a negative association with merely handling her. She
            could take a defensive posture toward you. This kind of association
            can be difficult to break.{' '}

            The simple answer is, no. Absolutely not. But there are exceptions.

            Trimming a cat's claws every few weeks is an important part of
            maintaining your pet's health. Not only does a quick trim protect
            you, your pet and your family, it can also save your sofa, curtains
            and other furniture.

          <p>
            It is better to accustom your cat to this practice from a young age.
            Use an appropriate claw clipper bought at the vet clinic or in a pet
            shop. Choose a quiet place to avoid scaring the pet. There are 4
            steps:{' '}

            Don't worry, they will be fully trained when we hand the kittens to

            they successfully use it for the first time.{' '}
          </p>

          <p>Follow these steps for how to litter train a kitten:</p>
          <p>
            · Show her the boxes as soon as she arrives by setting her in them
            and letting her sniff and examine them. Be sure not to move the
            boxes once you've shown them to her, to avoid confusing her.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            · Set your cat in one of the boxes immediately following meals and
            after she wakes up from naps. If you notice her behaving like she
            needs to go, which might look like sniffing or crouching in a
            particular area, pick her up and put her in her litter box.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            · Reward her whenever you notice her using it. Praise her and give
            her a treat or a toy.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            · Don't punish or scold her for accidents. Doing so will only lead
            to stress and anxiety, which may exacerbate the problem and make
            training more difficult. Cats do not associate punishment with the
            incident in question, so it doesn't help train her not to do it in
            the future.{' '}

            It's important to take proper care of the litter box. Not only will
            this help eliminate the dreaded "cat smell" from your home, but it
            will also make using the box a more pleasant experience for your
            cat.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            · Scoop the box daily to remove your kitten's deposits. Replace
            soiled litter as needed.{' '}
          </p>

            · Clean and disinfect the box when you change out the litter. Use

            The benefit is that spaying or neutering reduces or eliminates
            sexual behaviors in cats that people generally consider a nuisance.
            In most male cats, regardless of their age when neutered, neutering
            reduces roaming, urine spraying, and fights with neighborhood cats.
            The plaintive howling of female cats in heat is eliminated.{' '}

          <p>
            Whether male or female, you can get your cat spayed or neutered
            around puberty. This is at six to seven months old, although it can
            be done safely from the age of three months.{' '}

          Who
          <p>should consider pet insurance? </p>
          <p>
            Every pet owner should consider pet insurance. Even if you believe
            you have enough money to cover veterinary costs, pet insurance could
            still save you thousands of dollars if your pet gets sick or
            injured.
          </p>
          <p>Why should I have pet insurance? </p>
          <p>
            Our pets’ lives come with uncertainties. Aside from the financial
            benefits, pet insurance can also protect your cats from missing out
            on the care they need. Insurance allows for more opportunities to
            diagnose illnesses and obtain treatment — even expensive treatments
            like surgeries and cancer care. Like most insurance, pet insurance
            gives you peace of mind.
