          <p>
            How much a cat needs to eat depends on a variety of factors,
            including size, age, metabolic rate, the amount it exercises, and
            even environmental temperatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kittens require about 200 calories a day per five pounds of body
            weight (after weaning). Look at the feeding guide on your cat food
            label. This will give you a general idea of how much to put in her
            food bowl.

          <p>
            Many cat owners feed meals in the morning and evening, while others
            leave dry food out during the day. In reality cats love to graze,
            eating multiple small meals throughout the day and night.
          </p>
          Kittens require more food per pound of body weight to support their
          growth than do adult cats, and therefore should be fed more often
          throughout the day. "Growing kittens up to six months of age may
          require three meals a day," says Francis Kallfelz, DVM, Ph.D. How
          often you feed your cat may depend on your schedule as well.

      title: 'Should You Feed Your Cat Both Wet and Dry Food?',

        <div>
          <p>
            Many veterinarians recommend that cats eat a diet of exclusively or
            mostly wet food. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, cats
            are obligate carnivores and are not designed to ingest many
            carbohydrates (if any). Dry food will automatically contain many
            more carbohydrates than wet food. Secondly, most cats are not big
            water drinkers and tend to keep themselves on the edge of
            dehydration. Wet food naturally provides more water in the diet,
            which supports the kidneys, urinary tract, and overall health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Theoretically speaking, if the calories are not exceeded, the
            proportion of wet food in the cat's diet should be as much as
            possible. However, because dry food is easy to store and
            cost-effective, most cat owners will choose dry food as the main
            food, and supplemented by canned food.

          <p>
            Core vaccines are those recommended for all cats, no matter where
            they live or under what conditions.
          </p>
          <p>The four core vaccines for cats are:</p> · Rabies · FVRCP: o Feline
          Rhinotracheitis Virus/Herpesvirus 1 (FVR/FHV-1) o Feline Calicivirus
          (FCV) o Feline Panleukopenia (FPV) Kitten vaccination schedule · First
          visit (6 to 8 weeks) FVRCP · Second visit (10-12 weeks) FVRCP · Third
          visit (14-16weeks) FVRCP Rabies · Six months Spay or neuter
          <p>
            When Dingdong Paw handed kittens to you, they had completed the
            first vaccine, which included FVRCP vaccine, physical examination,
            and deworming. You need to complete the second and third vaccines
            yourself. It is recommended that you find a veterinary clinic near
            your home with a good reputation, which can save a lot of trouble in
            the future.

      title: 'Do cats need baths?',
      content: (
        <div>
          Many cats, especially those with short coats, are good self-groomers
          and rarely require bathing. In fact, cats can spend up to 50% of their
          waking hours grooming to cover themselves with their scent. So when
          you step in and bathe them, you are essentially erasing their ID.
          Moreover, if you choose to bathe your cat regularly, you are
          cultivating a negative association with merely handling her. She could
          take a defensive posture toward you. This kind of association can be
          difficult to break. The simple answer is, no. Absolutely not. But
          there are exceptions. You can bath them if the cat gets into something
          and smells, If the cat becomes uncomfortably dirty or sticky, If the
          cat picks up bugs in its fur. There are tub-less ways you can
          proactively clean your cat like… Clean inside of their ears Trim their
          nails Brush regularly, especially if your cat is a long hair

        <div>
          Trimming a cat's claws every few weeks is an important part of
          maintaining your pet's health. Not only does a quick trim protect you,
          your pet and your family, it can also save your sofa, curtains and
          other furniture. It is better to accustom your cat to this practice
          from a young age. Use an appropriate claw clipper bought at the vet
          clinic or in a pet shop. Choose a quiet place to avoid scaring the
          pet. There are 4 steps: 1. Hold your pet against your body; 2. Take
          the paw between your thumb and your index finger; 3. Press slightly on
          the top of the toe to extend the claw outward; 4. Clip the claw a few
          millimeters, without exceeding the transparent part.

          Don't worry, they will be fully trained when we hand the kittens to
          you. You just need to move them into the litter box frequently until
          they successfully use it for the first time. Follow these steps for
          how to litter train a kitten: · Show her the boxes as soon as she
          arrives by setting her in them and letting her sniff and examine them.
          Be sure not to move the boxes once you've shown them to her, to avoid
          confusing her. · Set your cat in one of the boxes immediately
          following meals and after she wakes up from naps. If you notice her
          behaving like she needs to go, which might look like sniffing or
          crouching in a particular area, pick her up and put her in her litter
          box. · Reward her whenever you notice her using it. Praise her and
          give her a treat or a toy. · Don't punish or scold her for accidents.
          Doing so will only lead to stress and anxiety, which may exacerbate
          the problem and make training more difficult. Cats do not associate
          punishment with the incident in question, so it doesn't help train her
          not to do it in the future. Cleaning and Maintenance It's important to
          take proper care of the litter box. Not only will this help eliminate
          the dreaded "cat smell" from your home, but it will also make using
          the box a more pleasant experience for your cat. · Scoop the box daily
          to remove your kitten's deposits. Replace soiled litter as needed. ·
          Clean and disinfect the box when you change out the litter. Use mild
          soap and water. Don't use bleach.

        <div>
          The benefit is that spaying or neutering reduces or eliminates sexual
          behaviors in cats that people generally consider a nuisance. In most
          male cats, regardless of their age when neutered, neutering reduces
          roaming, urine spraying, and fights with neighborhood cats. The
          plaintive howling of female cats in heat is eliminated. Whether male
          or female, you can get your cat spayed or neutered around puberty.
          This is at six to seven months old, although it can be done safely
          from the age of three months. CAT/KITTEN IS PURCHASED FOR PET. Buyer
          agrees to spay or neuter the kittens within 1 year of their birthdate.
          If not, the buyer agrees to pay the fine.
